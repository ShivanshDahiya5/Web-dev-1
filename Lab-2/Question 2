       <p>Fish are aquatic, vertebrates (animals with backbones) that breathe with gills, are mostly covered in scales, and use fins to move. There is immense diversity within this group, with species living in every aquatic environment, from freshwater rivers to deep oceans, and exhibiting a wide range of sizes and adaptations for survival, such as bioluminescent lures for deep-sea hunting.  </p>
